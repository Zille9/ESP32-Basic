This text adventure game runs under CP/M 2.2 on any type of terminal.

The game consists of three files:     BARSOOM.COM
                                      BARSOOM1.DAT
                                      BARSOOM2.DAT

(Once you have "saved" your position during the game there will 
also be a "BARSOOM.SAV" file.)

To play: have the three files, extracted from the library and unsqueezed,
on your logged drive.  Type "BARSOOM" -- it starts with a couple of
screens of instructions.

Complaints and bug reports can be addressed to Susan Schnitger on the Boskug
BBS at 617-965-7046.
