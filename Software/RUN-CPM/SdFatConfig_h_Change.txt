@Olimex: which problem did you have to compile RunCPM woth SDFat Library 2.2.2? Here on my system it does compile fine.
Did you the “normal” change of the SdFatConfig.h which is mentioned at the original RunCPM Github-Page https://github.com/MockbaTheBorg/RunCPM
under the Section “SdFat Library change”?
————————————————————-
SdFat library change
If you get a ‘File’ has no member named ‘dirEntry’ error, then a modification is needed on the SdFat Library SdFatConfig.h file (line 78 as of version 2.0.2) changing:
#define SDFAT_FILE_TYPE 3
to
#define SDFAT_FILE_TYPE 1
As file type 1 is required for most of the RunCPM ports.

To find your libraries folder, open the Preferences in Arduino IDE and look at the Sketchbook location field.

On Windows systems, SdFatConfig.h will be in Documents\Arduino\libraries\SdFat\src
————————————————————-

BTW: This change has to be done also every time you update the SdFat-Library, because it overwrites thsi change.

See also that this solved my issue since SdFat-Library v2.0.2:
